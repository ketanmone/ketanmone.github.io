## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Module Overview  

This e-portfolio showcases my learning journey throughout the **Security and Risk Management** module, which contributes 40% to my overall MSc Cyber Security grade.  
It demonstrates how I applied theoretical frameworks, collaborated with peers, and developed both qualitative and quantitative risk assessments for a realistic business scenario ‚Äî *Pampered Pets Ltd*.  

The e-portfolio consolidates:  
- Team project artefact (Unit 6)  
- Individual project artefact (Unit 11)  
- Critical reflection on personal growth and professional development  
- Comprehensive references in Harvard style

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Unit 6 ‚Äî Team Status Document (Pampered Pets)

**Project:** *Pampered Pets ‚Äì Risk Assessment and Recommendations* (Team Cipher)  

**Objective:** Evaluate the risks of digitalising a local pet-food business and expanding through an international supply chain.  

**Methodology:** Applied the **ISO 31000 Risk Management Framework** to identify, assess, and mitigate risks across physical, operational, and cyber domains.  

**My Contribution:**  
- Constructed the risk identification matrix and likelihood-impact assessment.  
- Drafted the Phase 1‚Äì4 mitigation roadmap (IT hygiene ‚Üí E-commerce ‚Üí Inventory ‚Üí Supply chain).  
- Synthesised references and formatted the report for submission.  

**Key Findings:**  
- Digitalisation introduces higher cyber and compliance risks but greater growth potential.  
- The phased approach ensures resilience and avoids operational strain.  
- Early investment in staff training and secure infrastructure significantly lowers residual risk.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Unit 11 ‚Äî Individual Executive Summary (Quantitative Risk Modelling & BC/DR)

**Project:** *Quantitative Risk Modelling and Business Continuity Strategy for Pampered Pets Ltd.*  

**Objective:** Quantitatively estimate the probability that digitalisation could endanger product quality or supply-chain continuity, and design a resilient Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) strategy.  

**Approach & Models Used:**  
- **Monte Carlo Simulation (10,000 iterations):** to model uncertainty and compute expected loss probabilities.  
- **Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA):** to rank failure modes using severity √ó occurrence √ó detection.  
- **Frameworks referenced:** ISO 31000, ISO 22301, ISO/IEC 27001, and GDPR Article 32.  

**Key Results:**  
- Cyber-attack probability: 28 % (High) ‚Üí top priority control area.  
- Automation error: 14 % (Moderate) ‚Üí mitigated through predictive maintenance.  
- Combined annual disruption probability reduced from 21 % to < 10 % after mitigation.  

**BC/DR Recommendations:**  
- Hybrid multi-cloud setup (AWS primary + Azure secondary).  
- RTO ‚â§ 60 s  |  RPO ‚â§ 60 s  |  Availability = 24 / 7 / 365.  
- Quarterly DR simulations and ISO 22301 audits to maintain readiness.  

**Impact:**  
The study converts compliance frameworks into predictive resilience, enabling the business to withstand operational shocks with minimal downtime and reputational risk.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Reflection (Rolfe et al., 2001 ‚Äì What / So What / Now What)

### **What? ‚Äì Description of my learning and project experience**

Throughout this module, I transitioned from understanding basic risk frameworks to integrating quantitative models that inform executive decisions.  
Working in **Team Cipher** for the Pampered Pets case gave me hands-on experience applying **ISO 31000** to a real-world digitalisation challenge. My responsibility was to design a pragmatic mitigation plan that balanced opportunity with resilience.  

The **individual project** deepened this work by introducing **Monte Carlo Simulation** and **FMEA**. These methods revealed how probability distributions, rather than fixed scores, better represent uncertainty in cyber and operational risk.  
Designing a **multi-cloud BC/DR architecture** taught me to merge technical precision with strategic foresight ‚Äî ensuring that resilience isn‚Äôt just theoretical but operationally achievable.

---

### **So What? ‚Äì Critical analysis and personal insight**

Initially, I saw risk management as primarily documentation.  
However, developing the simulation model showed me that **risk is dynamic** ‚Äî a moving probability shaped by technology, people, and process maturity.  
I learned the importance of linking **control effectiveness** to measurable outcomes, such as reduction in expected annual loss.  

Emotionally, collaboration in a virtual team was both rewarding and demanding.  
Balancing different working styles required empathy and structure. Using GitHub for version control and Microsoft Teams for coordination improved my ability to manage distributed teamwork ‚Äî an essential skill in cybersecurity operations.  

Critically reviewing frameworks revealed why adoption often fails: organisational culture, budget constraints, and ‚Äúcheck-box compliance.‚Äù  
I connected this to **Renn et al. (2021)** who argue that sustainable digitalisation must embed ethics and human oversight.  
This influenced my stance that resilience must include **human-in-the-loop** decision-making ‚Äî ensuring automation never replaces accountability.  

The project also heightened my awareness of **ethical trade-offs** in AI-driven monitoring. While automation boosts detection, it can encroach on privacy. Aligning with **GDPR Art. 32**, I learned to advocate for privacy-by-design principles in every architectural decision.

### **Now What? ‚Äì Application and future professional growth**

Professionally, I plan to implement risk-based thinking in all future design projects.  
Before launching any digital solution, I will initiate a one-page **Risk Charter** defining assets, threats, RTO/RPO tolerances, and responsible owners.  
This structure ensures continuous monitoring rather than one-off assessment.  

Technically, my next step is to expand from Monte Carlo to **Bayesian network models** and **attack-defence trees** for richer causal analysis.  
These methods will also strengthen my upcoming dissertation on IoT and CPS security.  

From a leadership perspective, this module reinforced the value of **quantifying uncertainty** to drive stakeholder trust.  
Presenting risks with statistical confidence intervals makes cybersecurity investment tangible to executives.  
In future roles, I aim to promote this evidence-based communication culture.  

On a personal level, the module strengthened my self-efficacy. I now view security not as avoiding failure but **engineering graceful recovery** ‚Äî transforming crisis into competence.  
Resilience, therefore, becomes a continuous practice aligned with both business goals and ethical responsibility.
